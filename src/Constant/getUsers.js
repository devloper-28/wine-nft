			"Al began working in the wine trade in 1971, first in retail as a buyer for a noted off license seller of fine wine. After some years, he moved on to the wholesale import business with a company called Classic Wine Imports in Boston. Classic was the exclusive importer for Guigal as well as a host of other well known high quality brands. By the early 1980’s he owned a retail store in Boston jointly with another well regarded import company called Ideal Wine and Spirits. He also had, at the time, started the Odd Wine Company to work with exporters in France and the UK. He mainly imported top quality fine and rare wine which he then sold to retailers, restaurants and wealthy private clients in the US as the Odd Wine company during the early 2000’s. He created a new company called Alliance with an English merchant, Philip Slocombe. They sold large quantities of classified Bordeaux, Sourced in America, and sold back into the British market exploiting the exchange rate differentials between the two countries' currencies. Today, he runs two companies, The Odd Wine Company which sells old and rare wine and Vinology which has been set up to sell more contemporary wine.",

Although his winemaking resume is grand, his personality and skills are far beyond. Kennedy describes Marc as a brilliant combination of artist & scientist. Gagnon leads the winemaking strategy and oversees all portfolio winemaking & production in collaboration with Kennedy. Gagnon has been described as “utterly brilliant” by Antonio Galloni, the famed wine critic and founder of Vinous. With Marc leading international wine making efforts, the portfolio is stronger than it has ever been. Marc lives in Napa & travels to each site as needed.',
